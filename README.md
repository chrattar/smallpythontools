#### Python Tool Collection

Assorted Python Tools I have createdf for a variety of small tasks. I am sure Chat-GPT can recreate many of these in this day and age, but I like to see some of the smaller things I have built.

### WEBP to PNG
Created in order to run a quick change of file format from any saved webp files. Mainly because not all OS have ggod software to open this. I also dislike using online image converters as they are a vulnerability
img_converter - Script to convert WEBP files to PNG

### Folium Geolocation Tool  
Prebuilt tool to take GPS coordinates and map to OpenStreet Map grid. Created to integrate into an ERP without additional fees associated with the vendor provided options
